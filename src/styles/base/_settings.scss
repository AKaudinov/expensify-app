$mobile-breakpoint: 45rem; //in media queries this 45rem isn't 450px, it will be 720px. media queries don't take into account the
//calculations done in the stylings, in this case we made html font size 62.5% so 1 rem = 10 px.
//where by default it is 1 rem = 16px << this is what the media queries will work like
//therefore 45rem x 16rem = 720px.


//Relative units in media queries are based on the initial value,
// which means that units are never based on results of declarations.
// For example, in HTML, the em unit is relative to the initial value of font-size,
// defined by the user agent or the userâ€™s preferences, not any styling on the page.
